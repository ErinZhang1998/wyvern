The Wyvern project
==================
The Wyvern programming language is a new language designed to smooth the use of internal DSLs in the form of type-specific languages.

To run Wyvern, run bin/wyvern from the root directory after compiling, or run wyvern.tools.interpreter.

Layout
-----------------
The tools directory contains the Wyvern compiler, the command line interface, and the supported tests.

From this point onwards, we refer to paths relative to ./tools/src.

The compiler itself is within wyvern/tools, with most of its support files also contained within that directory.

The currently maintained examples of Wyvern are part of the Wyvern compiler test suite, in wyvern/tools/tests/embedded. These tests use a DSL for each test, where each test is in a block of the form

```
  test [testname]([expected value]:[expected type])
    [test code]
```

Compilation
-----------------
Wyvern requires the Java 8 JDK.

It is strongly reccomended to use an IDE to compile Wyvern. Eclipse Kepler and IntelliJ 13 or up are supported. Please import the included project in tools/.project to do so.

Wyvern depends on a number of autogenerated files. Generating these files is the sole responsibillity of build.xml, and running this build is required before the compiler can be built.
