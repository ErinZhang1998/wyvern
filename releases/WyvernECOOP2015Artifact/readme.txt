To run:

java -jar wyvern.jar borderedwindow.wyv

or

java -jar wyvern.jar json.wyv

For your reference we provided the tests folder which is a copy of our JUnit tests folder with tag related code from GitHub, however some tests are supposed to make Wyvern fail to compile them and some expect it to succeed. Its best to run them with JUnit by checking out the full source code from GitHub.
